Changing a mongodb object
-------------------------
To add a member to a mongodb object, simply update the Play db model or update the mongodb
object directly. Existing mongodb objects will need to be updated using
db.<collection>.update()

For example, after creating multiple users I decided to include a status which would represent
the active/inactive state of a user. I will also want to add a permission level in the future.
To do so, I modified the application to begin storing this data type with the mongodb object. 
I also updated existing users with the following query in the terminal.

 db.User.update({className: "models.User"},{$set: {status: 1}}, {multi: true})

 Running Mongodb and Mongo
 -------------------------
 Install mongodb. 
 While in development, to run the Mongodb access the terminal and type
 mongodb. This will run the mongo db database. To access mongo via the commandline
 and view and manipulate database items, type mongo on the command line, in a different
 tab.

 > mongodb
 [launches the mongo database so it's available for your application]

 > mongo
 [access mongo via the shell]
